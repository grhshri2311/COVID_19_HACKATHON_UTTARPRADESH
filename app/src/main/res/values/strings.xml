Actions to take\n
Follow your Asthma Action Plan.\n
Keep your asthma under control.\n
Continue your current medications, including any inhalers with steroids in them (“steroids” is another word for corticosteroids).\n
Know how to use your inhaler.\n
Avoid your asthma triggers.\n
If possible, have another member of your household who doesn’t have asthma clean and disinfect your house for you. When they use cleaning and disinfecting products, have them:\n
Make sure that people with asthma are not in the room.\n
Minimize use of disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack.\n
Open windows or doors and use a fan that blows air outdoors.\n
Always follow the instructions on the product label.\n
Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows).\n
Why you might be at higher risk\n
\nCOVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner2">Chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis may increase a person’s risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nIf you are on dialysis, you should NOT miss your treatments.
\nContact your dialysis clinic and your healthcare provider if you feel sick or have concerns.
\nPlan to have enough food on hand to follow the KCER 3-Day Emergency Diet Plan pdf iconpdf icon[PDF – 8 pages]external iconexternal icon for dialysis patients in case you are unable to maintain your normal treatment schedule.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nDialysis patients are more prone to infection and severe illness because of weakened immune systems; treatments and procedures to manage kidney failure; and coexisting conditions such as diabetes.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner3">Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nKeep taking your current medications, including those with steroids in them (“steroids” is another word for corticosteroids).
\nAvoid triggers that make your symptoms worse.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nBased on data from other viral respiratory infections, COVID-19 might cause flare-ups of chronic lung diseases leading to severe illness.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner4">Diabetes, including type 1, type 2, or gestational, may put people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nContinue taking your diabetes pills and insulin as usual.
\nTest your blood sugar every four hours and keep track of the results.
\nMake sure that you have at least a two-week supply of your diabetes pills and insulin.
\nFollow the sick day guidelines for people with diabetes.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nPeople with diabetes whose blood sugar levels are often higher than their target are more likely to have diabetes-related health problems. Those health problems can make it harder to overcome COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner5">Hemoglobin disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nAsk your healthcare provider about telemedicine or remote healthcare visits, and know when to go to the emergency department.
\nWork with your healthcare provider to manage medications and therapies for your disorder (including hydroxyurea, chelation therapy, blood transfusions, and prescriptions for pain management) and any other health condition you may have (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis).
\nTry to prevent vaso-occlusive episodes or pain crises by avoiding possible triggers.
\nReview our healthy living with SCD guide or our healthy living with thalassemia guide for tips to help you stay healthy.
\nFind SCD resources and thalassemia resources to help navigate care and increase knowledge and awareness of SCD and thalassemia.
\nLet friends and family know about the need for healthy blood donors.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nLiving with a hemoglobin disorder can lead to serious multi-organ complications, and underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, liver disease, diabetes, iron overload, kidney disease, viral infections, or weakened immune system) may increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner6">Many conditions and treatments can cause a person to have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised), including cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell count or not on HIV treatment, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications. People who are Immunocompromised
\nActions to take
\nIf you are immunocompromised, continue any recommended medications or treatments and follow the advice of your healthcare provider.
\nCall your healthcare provider if you have concerns about your condition or feel sick.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nPeople with a weakened immune system have reduced ability to fight infectious diseases, including viruses like COVID-19. Knowledge is limited about the virus that causes COVID-19, but based on similar viruses, there is concern that immunocompromised patients may remain infectious for longer than other COVID-19 patients.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner7">Chronic liver disease,  including cirrhosis, may increase risk for serious illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nTake your medications exactly as prescribed.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nSevere illness caused by COVID-19 and the medications used to treat some severe consequences of COVID-19 can cause strain on the liver, particularly for those with underlying liver problems. People living with serious liver disease can have a weakened immune system, leaving the body less able to fight COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner8">Older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nTake your medications for any underlying health conditions exactly as prescribed.
\nFollow the advice of your healthcare provider.
\nDevelop a care plan that summarizes your health conditions and current treatments.
\nPrepare yourself to stay home for long periods using this checklist.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nAlthough COVID-19 can affect any group, the older you are, the higher your risk of serious disease. Eight out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years or older; risk of death is highest among those 85 years or older. The immune systems of older adults weaken with age, making it harder to fight off infections. Also, older adults commonly have chronic diseases that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner9">Many cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have occurred among older adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities
\nActions to take
\nCarefully follow your facility’s instructions for infection prevention.
\nNotify staff right away if you feel sick.
\nAsk your caretakers about the actions that are being taken at your nursing home or long-term care facility to protect you and your loved ones, including if and how they are limiting visitors.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nThe communal nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, and the population served (generally older adults often with underlying medical conditions), put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness from COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner10">Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
\nActions to take
\nTake your medication exactly as prescribed. Continue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) as prescribed by your healthcare provider for indications such as heart failure or high blood pressure. This is recommended by current clinical guidelines.
\nMake sure that you have at least a two-week supply of your heart disease medications (such as those to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure).
\nPeople with hypertension should continue to manage and control their blood pressure and take their medication as directed.
\nWhy you might be at higher risk
\nCOVID-19, like other viral illnesses such as the flu, can damage the respiratory system and make it harder for your heart to work. For people with heart failure and other serious heart conditions this can lead to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.</string>
    <string name="orphanspinner11">Severe obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, puts people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19.
 \nActions to take
\nTake your medications for any underlying health conditions exactly as prescribed.

\nSevere obesity increases the risk of a serious breathing problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major complication of COVID-19 and can cause difficulties with a doctor’s ability to provide respiratory support for seriously ill patients. People living with severe obesity can have multiple serious chronic diseases and underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</string>
